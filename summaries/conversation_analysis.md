# Gravity Wells & Missiles - Conversation Analysis

## Project Overview
A 2D top-down space artillery game where two players fire projectiles through asteroid fields with strong gravity effects.

## Chronological Development

### Phase 1: Basic Game Setup & Controls
- Initial implementation of core game mechanics
- Changed controls to W/A keys for power adjustment instead of time-based charging
- Improved trajectory projection visibility
- Reduced bullet size to 3 pixels
- Added controls tooltip
- Stopped asteroid spinning for visual clarity
- Expanded asteroid field size

### Phase 2: Physics & Gameplay Refinement
- Fixed trajectory prediction to extend to screen edge or collision
- Reduced asteroid velocity for stability
- Increased gravity constant from 1000 to 6000 for stronger effects
- Aligned projectile spawn positions with trajectory predictions

### Phase 3: Weapon System Implementation
- Added homing missiles with intelligent navigation
- Created delayed homing missiles (2-second delay before activation)
- Replaced right-click weapon toggle with number key selection (1/2/3)
- Implemented weapon type indicators

### Phase 4: Visual Enhancements
- Added gravity field visualization using gradient circles
- Implemented debug visualization for homing missile logic
- Created composite blending effects for gravity fields
- Added color-coded thrust direction indicators

### Phase 5: Advanced Homing Algorithm
- Designed multi-phase planning algorithm for missiles
- Implemented 3-phase trajectory evaluation system
- Created HomingCalculator abstraction using strategy pattern
- Added collision avoidance through trajectory planning

### Phase 6: Architecture Refactoring
- Discovered DelayedMissile was using outdated homing algorithm
- Refactored entire homing system for code reuse
- Both missile types now use identical multi-phase planning
- Implemented clean separation of concerns

### Phase 7: Bidirectional Thrust Enhancement
- Extended thrust range from 120° to 270°
- Enabled missiles to slow down and reverse direction
- Added color-coded debug visualization (green/red/gray)
- Improved maneuverability in complex asteroid fields

## Key Technical Achievements
- TypeScript with strict typing and OOP design
- Real-time physics simulation with vector mathematics
- Multi-phase trajectory planning with lookahead
- Strategy pattern for extensible homing algorithms
- Git version control implementation
- Canvas 2D rendering with composite operations
